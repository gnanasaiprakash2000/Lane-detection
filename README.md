# üõ£Ô∏è Lane Detection using U-Net

Lane detection is a crucial **computer vision task** that involves identifying the boundaries of driving lanes in an image or video of a road scene.  
It plays a vital role in **autonomous vehicles** and **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.  

Traditional methods like the **Hough Transform** struggle under varying lighting or shadow conditions.  
With the rise of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, lane detection has become more robust and accurate ‚Äî especially when using the **U-Net architecture** for semantic segmentation.

## üß† U-Net Architecture

U-Net is a **deep learning architecture** designed specifically for **semantic segmentation** tasks ‚Äî dividing an image into meaningful regions.  
In the context of **lane detection**, it helps the model learn both the **line features** and **contextual information** around lanes.

- The encoder captures **spatial features**.
- The decoder reconstructs **pixel-level segmentation** maps.

This architecture effectively improves both **accuracy** and **real-time performance** in complex road environments.
